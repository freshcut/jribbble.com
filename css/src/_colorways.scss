/*-------- Media Query Color shifting, big fun, big fun!
	This is where shit gets real. The base color I start with is #ff0066, from there
    as the browswer scales down, the colors adjust to be cooler. As the browser 
    scales up, the colors adjust to be warmer.

    If you're looking here you're probably interested, I use SASS so for all of the
    colors I don't have to find exact hex number. I use a built in SASS function
    adjust-hue(). I just pass it the base color and adjust the degree value that I
    want to change. Also, the entire CSS block is in a SASS mixin that takes a color
    parameter. That allows me to only write the selectors and rules one time, then
    include them in each of the media queries. Neato!
